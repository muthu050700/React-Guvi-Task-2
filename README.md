# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I have created a Landing page. This webpage very responsive.

I have creacted seperate components for seperate content. for example : Header, body etc..

I have used a reusable components, props and usestate.

1. what is component?
   The componets is just a normal JS function which returns some piece of JSX.

2. What is Props?
   a) First of all, we use props to pass the data in component.
   b) we component is just a normal JS function. So props is just like passing an
   argument to function.

3. what is usestate?
   a) Usestate is a hook. Used to create a local state variable.

   b) whenever the state variable changes the component will rerender the componet.
